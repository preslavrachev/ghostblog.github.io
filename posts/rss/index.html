It is thus good to see <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com">other people</a> standing on the same side of the bridge:</p><blockquote>As we ventured into micro-services onboarding time skyrocketed. Yes, we have docker and orchestration such as K8s these days to help, but the time from start to up and running a K8s cluster just to onboard a new engineer is orders of magnitude larger than we saw a few years ago. For many junior engineers this is a burden that really is unnecessary complexity.</blockquote><p>What most programmers forget is that a) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo-culting</a> is a thing, and b) micro-services are just a tool like anything else. I have fallen into this trap myself quite a few times myself. Just like you won't use Objective-C for Web development or embed an Oracle database inside your mobile app, <em>you don't have to use micro-services in every project you are working on</em>. You can, but in 90% of the cases, you won't need to. As with most things in life, a micro-service (or macro) architecture is something you reach out of necessity. Unless requirements force you right off the bat, focus on building your product as a single, unified core instead.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong> A micro-service architecture shifts the complexity form the code to the infrastructure, Or, as I used to say: <em>"Before micro-services, I chased domain problems, now I am mostly chasing Kubernetes issues, in order to get to the domain problems"</em></p><p><a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/13/give-me-back-my-monolith/">Give Me Back My Monolith</a> was also featured in the latest of the <a href="https://pythonbytes.fm">Python Bytes</a> podcast:</p><audio controls src="https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/download/122/give-me-back-my-monolith.mp3"></audio><p></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/13/give-me-back-my-monolith/">Give Me Back My Monolith</a></li><li><a href="https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/122/give-me-back-my-monolith">Episode #122: Give Me Back My Monolith | Python Bytes Podcast</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using Ephemeral Docker Containers as CLI Applications]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Docker containers have proven themselves extremely useful in allowing developers to sandbox environments and ease the deployment of services.

Have a complicated service setup? No worries. Simply, describe the steps in a <code>Dockerfile</code> and you should be able to replicate the process on every host OS that has Docker support.</p>
<p>When I said services, I bet that the first thing you thought about was HTTP servers, or some sort of persistent, always running processes that send or accept requests to such services. While the majority of Docker use cases fit exactly into this scenario, the realm of possible applications it offers, far exceeds that.</p>
<p>One such application is the use of Docker containers to sandbox the complex inner workings of a command-line (CLI) application. Most data projects involve the running of scheduled scripts which access remote services, do data processing and eventually, write the results either to disk, or to dedicated data storage. Such scripts have required dependencies, and often, the dependencies of one may collide with the ones required by another, which ends up in a big mess. This is the primary reason, why things like virtual environments in Python or Node.js' notorious <code>node_modules</code> folder exist in the first place. Yet, we all know one or two about <code>node_modules</code>...</p>
<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/circleci-performance-difference-between-cache-and-workspace-5567679c3601"><img src="https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1600%2F0*i5S2tUk0CQBh1Euc.&amp;f=1" alt="Using Ephemeral Docker Containers as CLI Applications"></a></p>
<p>The ideal case for such applications would be statically-bound executable files containing everything needed, and running into their own dedicated processes. One such approach is championed by languages like Go, Swift, and Kotlin's Native option (and of course, good old C/C++). Others, like Java (fat Jars) and Python (wheels) offer a somewhat reasonable compromise by putting the code and every dependency into a single deployable artifact. I call this a compromise, because it still requires the presence of either JDK or a Python runtime on the host OS.</p>
<p>The majority of the time however, we won't have the opportunity to deploy everything into a single executable. Much of the time, we also won't have the freedom to install different runtimes globally. In such cases, baking a CLI application together with all of its dependencies into a dedicated Docker image can be a good option. Let's try a simple example:</p>
<h2 id="anexample">An Example</h2>
<p>Here is a simple Python script, which will fetch the current price of Bitcoin, and convert it to a desired fiat currency of our choice (&quot;USD&quot;, &quot;EUR&quot;).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import argparse
import requests

def fetch(currency):
    price = requests.get(&quot;https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json&quot;).json()[&quot;bpi&quot;][currency][&quot;rate_float&quot;]

    print(price)

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=&quot;My Fancy CLI&quot;)
parser.add_argument(
    '--currency',
    help='Choose currency to convert to',
)
args = parser.parse_args()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    print(args)
    if args.currency:
        fetch(args.currency)
    else:
        parser.print_help()
</code></pre>
<p>There are two things to keep a note on, in this example. First, is the use of <code>requests</code>, a popular HTTP request/response library, but not a part of the Python standard library, so it has to be installed separately. Second, is the use of command-line arguments, namely <code>--currency</code>.</p>
<p>Next, is the <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM python:3.7
RUN pip install requests
COPY script.py .
ENTRYPOINT [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;script.py&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Again, very simple. In light of keeping the example simple, we will install <code>requests</code> right in the <code>Dockerfile</code> and using a <code>requirements.txt</code> file or some kind of a setup script, which are the common practice.</p>
<p>Let's build the image, assuming that both files are in our current directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker build -t my-command .
</code></pre>
<p>Great, now we can grab our newly baked image and run it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run --rm -it my-command --currency USD
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--rm</code> option will remove the container immediately after the command has been executed. If you have ever ran <code>docker ps -a</code>, you would know that inactive containers do not get deleted immediately, but are left for a possible later restart. Assuming that we would like to run our command multiple times per day, this will result in lots of wasted resources.</p>
<p>The other interesting option is <code>-i</code>. This one, combined with the fact that we chose <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> instead of <code>CMD</code> for our starting point in the <code>Dockerfile</code> would allow us to pass the <code>--currency</code> argument at the very end. There are a few subtle differences between <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> and <code>CMD</code> but the very basic is the ability to adapt <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, while <code>CMD</code> is more or less final.</p>
<p>You can, of course, create an alias fo your command to make the execution easier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">alias my-cmd=&quot;docker run --rm -i my-command&quot;

my-cmd --currency USD
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now you can ahead and run your application as a scheduled cron task and e.g. accrue data over time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">*/10 * * * * user ./my-cmd --currency USD &gt;&gt; prices.csv
</code></pre>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Once again, the solution is far from the ease of a drag-and-drop that Go executables allow. Also, it assumes a working Docker setup (less and less of an issue nowadays), and quite a bit of space, because of the images. It also, for the most part, requires building the image locally, or at least, pulling the ingredients from an image registry. Docker allows for an option to save an image with all of its dependencies and load it on a remote host OS. Think of it as a sort of fat-Jar. I tried it just for the sake of demonstration, but it seems very impractical, as it resulted in an enormous zip file for that tiny Python script (of course, it bakes a whole Linux bistro inside):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker save -o my-command.zip my-command
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rw------- 1 user user 920M Mar 17 08:47 my-command.zip
</code></pre>

Providing a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/">Service Worker</a>, helps the PWA show its full potential, by letting it do complex processing and synchronisation in the background, access local storage, or communicate with different kinds of low-level hardware periphery.</li></ol><p>Check out this insightful <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-355-progressive-web-apps-with-aaron-gustafson-live-at-microsoft-ignite/">podcast episode</a> to get more information.

The reason for this is simple. I have devoted much of my writing resources of the past weeks into a new site. A wiki called <a href="https://devnotes.space/">DevNotes</a>.</p><p>That is right, I have started a separate writing project, parallel to my blog. Yet, before you start thinking that this is the end of the blog, don't worry. <strong>This is just the beginning</strong>. In fact, a big motivator for starting the second site in the first place was being able to collect more thoughts and ideas for further blog posts.</p><p>I will explain my reasons and thoughts in the following paragraphs, but without further ado, I wanted to introduce <a href="https://devnotes.space/">DevNotes</a> to you. 🎉</p><h2 id="so-why-yet-another-site">So, why yet another site?</h2><p>The reason is simple. I needed a format for collecting knowledge, which would allow me to gradually build things up, without having to wrap and release everything as a post every time. This is the main benefit that a wiki offers. A wiki evolves a topic gradually, sometimes, a single character at a time.</p><p>A wiki is a journey and not a destination. It has no beginning and no defined ending. A wiki gets constantly updated and its pages are not frozen in time. A wiki is therefore not something a reader can comprehend in a linear fashion, but rather, a collection of reference nature. One does not read a wiki, one stumbles upon a wiki when searching for information.</p><p>A blog is slightly different. A blog has a timeline, and its posts are complete snapshots of the author's thoughts on a certain topic, at a certain moment in time. Once written, blog posts themselves seldom undergo changes. If updates are necessary, a new blog post gets written, or a whole series of posts gets created, to expand on the topic. In a way, blog posts are destinations.</p><p>One problem with destinations is that it takes time to reach them. Another problem is figuring out if you have reached a destination or not. Ironically, often, the only way to know if you have reached a destination is reaching it first and reflecting upon this fact in retrospect.</p><p>Where am I going with this? I want to see this blog evolve and deliver knowledgeable content to my readership. Yet, first and foremost, I want to learn. I have said it many times, and it is worth repeating that I am my blog's primary user. If I need some information, I'd first search it on my blog, and if I can't find it, I'd make sure to write about it, so I can have a cache for the next time I need it. This is where the wiki really helps. It will allow me to work on a topic without having to put it in a dedicated blog post, until I have enough information to make the post well-rounded enough. This is especially helpful to my limited time schedule, because having the wiki, I can keep making sure that my knowledge is available online as soon as I obtain it, without having to write a dedicated blog post until I am ready.</p><p>I am expecting to see a lot of convergence between the blog and the wiki in the coming future.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First 21K for 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Today, I finished my <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2188285011">first 21K run for 2019</a>.

This move was partially inspired by the fact that I haven't really run a distance much longer than 10-15K for the last 6 months. The other part though, was that I got into a challenge with my colleagues, using a clever iOS app called <a href="https://steps.im/?ref=producthunt">Steps</a> that just popped up on the horizon, and decided to beat my way up to the top. Long story short, I managed to do it, but it was mostly the 21K run that put the decisive drop in the bucket. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have made it - not even keeping in mind that I exclusively walked to and from work for a couple of days last week. Either my colleagues move a lot, or I have become a lazy sloth, and something needs to be done there.</p><p>That I am a bit out of shape, is indicative of the fact that as I am writing this, a few hours after I finished my run, I still feel as if a truck has run over my body.</p><p>But it's also the thing that no matter how much one practices, the distance is still challenging enough for your body to feel the pain every time. When I started running, almost three years ago, the mere thought of me running a half-marathon was close to unreal.

The mere thought that Go is a 21st Century version of C and has been explicitly designed from the start to not try to be much more than that, can make everyone coming from Kotlin and Swift pull a few hairs at first. The mere mentioning of C makes me shiver when I think about the crazy stuff I wrote in early high school  (circa. 2000/02). After school, I never gave C a chance anymore, but instead, moved on to languages, which at the time made my life easier.</p><p>In reality, programming with Go is not as harsh as I expected. Okay, it does look a lot like C, there are no classes, and pointers are everywhere, but you quickly get used to these, when you see the full picture. Unlike C, Go has a garbage collector, which means that a whole class of problems I had with memory management will simply not be present.</p><p>As for OOP, objects are still there, but their construction is slightly different. Go has eradicated inheritance and fosters composition instead. Go  The lack of a <code>class</code> construct has been more than sufficiently replaced by structs and <a href="https://gobyexample.com/interfaces">interfaces</a>. If all you need is a bag of properties (also referred to as "data class" in other languages), a <code>struct</code> should be perfectly sufficient. If you want to add functionality to your objects, Go's system of <a href="https://gobyexample.com/interfaces">attachable method receivers</a> makes it fairly easy to do so. In fact, after an hour of hour of work, I got pretty confident with it.</p><p>Pointers are also not the pain I expected them to be. In fact, they help things more transparent and explicit. Since in Go (almost) everything is passed by value (with the exception of <code>map</code> and <code>slice</code>) pointers actually help distinguish when the function you are passing the object will potentially want to mutate it or not.</p><p>Where Go really shines for me at the moment is the native performance and the build process. Five years ago, I would have screamed at the mere thought of this: statically compiling a binary and directly throwing it onto a remote machine where it just ... works. But it does, and compared to the complexity of modern containerized systems and dependency hell, this is just a breeze of fresh air.</p><p>I am leaving you with the video that made me open up my eyes for Go:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQ7STILAS0M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Re: Talk, Then Code]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>My response to <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2019/02/18/talk-then-code">Talk, then code</a> by <a href="https://dave.cheney.net">Dave Cheney</a>:</p><p>I cannot emphasize how important communication is in today's IT industry.

I know, I have been on the opposite site as well. 99% of the arguments in today's software projects are not because of lack of skills, but due to miscommunication. Our industry killed the one thing that makes us human beings - meaningful verbal communication. Covered by our headphones, hiding from what it seems a myriad of meaningless meetings, we often spend time developing stuff that does not fit into the final picture.

After the meetup, I realized that the topic is far deeper than just going through a few slides about what Kotlin as a language can and can't. Therefore, I decided to properly introduce the reader to the topic first. Next time, we will talk about where and how Kotlin can fit into the puzzle.</p><h1 id="the-problem-with-data">The Problem with Data</h1><p>We live in an age of unprecedented data abundance. So much, that our wishful imagination is easy to make us believe that we are on the verge of getting computers to think. Not surprisingly, when speaking about the future, the use of the term "AI" has recently become a favorite topic among company management and technology media alike.</p><p>Yet, in reality, we are only touching the surface. The path towards autonomous AI requires more basic human intervention than anything else. In particular, it needs a way for properly communicating data science into the software engineering field, and vice versa.</p><h1 id="aren-t-we-already-there">Aren't We Already There?</h1><p>Nope, not quite. Bringing data science into the production workflow of established companies is not as easy as one might think. More so, when talking about the JVM, which a vast majority of enterprise software has been built upon.</p><p>See, there is a mismatch between software engineering and data science practices:</p><p>Software engineering works best when building <em>well-defined systems.</em> Requirements are set at the beginning and ideally, evolve over time, but rarely change entirely. There are traceable boundaries between components, with deterministic inputs and outputs, to help testability and ease extension. Like other forms of engineering, building a piece of software starts with a rough skeleton, which gets iterated over time and again. The goal of every step is to make the software either more feature complete or gradually morph it into a new direction, but keep it compatible with the original requirements.</p><p>Data science, on the other hand, deals with supporting or refuting <em>hypotheses</em>. Like other fields of science, it starts with a relatively generic question and goes through a process of data exploration and validation, until either the question can be answered fully, or it needs to be formulated again, due to an insufficiency of the data/selected approach. The exploration phase often involves trying out different approaches and seeing a large portion of them fail. This is why it is so important for the data science field to use tools and technologies that allow for easy exploration and visualization of the underlying data.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/machine_learning.png" class="kg-image" alt="Kotlin ❤️ Data Science? (Part 1)"><figcaption>Machine Learning |&nbsp;xkcd</figcaption></figure><p>Another important difference between software engineering and data science is the interpretation of the outputs of systems at hand. Although, the understanding of distributed systems has almost become a science of its own, interpreting the outcome of a non-deterministic machine learning model is a whole different game. It is not easy to unit-test complex ML models, mainly because of the level of randomness they are built upon. Removing this randomness factor can help test the model in isolation, but might also provide the wrong assumptions when feeding the model with real-world data. Just like with the exploration phase above, it is a matter of having the right tools at hand and a fairly deep level of human interpretation.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/extrapolating.png" class="kg-image" alt="Kotlin ❤️ Data Science?

AI has had a long history of ups and downs, most notably its birth and early progress during the 1950s and 1960s,  followed by the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a> covering most of the late 1980s, 1990s, and the beginning of the 21st Century. The recent advancement of hardware technology has given researchers the opportunity to dig out the old papers, beat them off the dust, and re-imagine the utopian bright future, in which humans and machines become alike.</p><p>The fields of AI and Data Science have been complementing one another for a long time. Yet, while AI still seems rather ephemeral and difficult to grasp (a bit like Virtual Reality), Data Science resembles Augmented Reality, in that it employs technology, but leaves the ultimate decision and interpretation to humans.</p><p>Machine Learning (or ML, for short) is just one of the techniques that both rely on, in order to make machines reason about large amounts of data, but by far not the only one.</p><p>If you are looking for a more cynical view of the difference between the three you can rather use this one:</p><ul><li><strong>AI</strong> is what brings the VC Money in.</li><li><strong>ML</strong> (a.k.a <em>sophisticated brute-force</em>) is what gets the job done.  ML models are very limited to a given domain.  </li><li><strong>DS</strong> is the craft of finding which ML model works for a particular case, and which doesn't.</li></ul><p>Until next time!</p><h1 id="further-resources">Further Resources</h1><p>The slides of my talk:</p><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="99478ac60b134f5393f45d382b1d1bc6" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><h2 id="links">Links</h2><ul><li><a href="http://approximatelycorrect.com/2017/03/28/the-ai-misinformation-epidemic/">The AI Misinformation Epidemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/">The Difference Between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning? | NVIDIA Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-has-become-too-vague-538899bab57">"Data Science" Has Become Too Vague - Towards Data Science</a></li><li><a href="http://tomstechnicalblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/kotlin-for-data-science.html">Kotlin for Data Science</a></li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-misconceptions-about-deep-learning-f26c41faceec">Deep Misconceptions About Deep Learning - Towards Data Science</a></li><li><a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/423/what-is-your-favorite-data-analysis-cartoon/9254">What is your favorite "data analysis" cartoon?</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Medium Has Become All About Publications]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you are writing your first Medium post, eagerly hoping that you would earn an overnight readership you the thousands, you can simply forget it.

That is, unless you are willing to submit your post to a <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012095528-About-Medium-publications">publication</a>.</p><p>I am not writing this to discourage anyone from writing, just the contrary. I would love to see more and more people write. Yet, you also have to know what you are getting into, when posting your stuff to Medium. Medium in 2019 is not at all what it used to be in 2013. I have <a href="https://preslav.me/2018/09/05/medium-walled-garden/">touched upon this</a> in my blog already.</p><p>The thing is that posting to Medium alone is not going to bring your writings they reach they deserve, and this is a mere fact of basic economics. With everyone posting to one platform, it inevitably loses the aura of exclusivity it once had. Without a way of clustering writings into themed collections (a.k.a. <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012095528-About-Medium-publications">Publications</a>), a potential reader would always end up choosing either the same thing, or something completely random.</p><p>Publications help solve this by providing a thematic stream, which appeals to a more targeted audience. The downside of having to use publications to get your opinion heard, is that your writings lose their identity and you also put yourself at the mercy of the publication's editors. If you don't believe me, try to get a writing of yours into <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">HackerNoon</a> and once it gets approved, read it again. You'll see what I mean.</p><p>Why am I ranting about all of this? Because, if a platform is going to profit on the back of you, the writer, you deserve to know it. If all of this channeling of your thoughts becomes too much, just get off the platform and start your own blog. Be genuine, and stay true to your heart.</p><p>Peace. ✌🏼</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don't Build Your Products Around Technologies.

Build Technologies Around Your Products"><p></p><p>I had somehow assumed that this is something people learn, once they get burned by a few incidents. Yet, time and again, reality finds its ways to prove me wrong. So, I am compelled to say it once again:</p><p><em><strong>Don't build your products around technologies. Build technologies around your products.</strong></em></p><p>There was a time when I could swear my allegiance to any tool, framework, or library which happened to be at the heyday of public attention. I would toy around with it, talk about it, proclaim it to be the one and only solution to any problem, or use it to design solutions for problems I wouldn't really have. That is, until the company/community behind it, lost interest in moving the technology forward. The technology would quickly lose its coolness factor, die out of public interest, and get replaced by a new one, supposedly even cooler. Usually, it goes like this:</p><ol><li>Company ABC has a product problem</li><li>ABC comes up with a clever solution: XYZ</li><li>ABC decides to open-source XYZ</li><li>XYZ becomes an overnight hit</li><li>Other companies adopt XYZ for their products</li><li>With so many use cases, XYZ eventually becomes a burden to maintain</li><li>ABC gives up and moves along</li><li>XYZ dies out or gets replaced by a new shiny toy</li><li>Parts of XYZ eventually make it to a standard, but years after its fall from grace</li></ol><p>This cycle would repeat a few more times over the following years. And every time the same. A technology would appear from nowhere, quickly become overhyped, only to die out and get replaced soon thereafter. It becomes a burden. And, while refactoring is fun the first few times, the bigger and more mature my work got, the more difficult it became to justify the costs of eventually having to get rid of this burden, once it died out.</p><p>This is the reason, why nowadays, I would try to stick to a stack that first-and-foremost, solves the concrete problem at hand, and second, steps on the shoulders of standards. Indeed, my weapons of choice might not always be the fancy ones that one reads about on Medium. They might not have an interactive documentation site or a vocal Twitter community, but they get the job done, and they have proven themselves over the years. As for the fancy ones, I do play with new things every day, and many of them find their way in my projects. Yet, just like in investing, a certain level of risk assessment is needed. This is where the good architecture comes into play, clearly distinguishing components from one another, and abstracting dependencies away behind generic API contracts.</p><p>Final Note: A great technology is one that helps you solve a particular problem without becoming the centerpiece of your product. It conforms to standards and is thus easily swappable with any other one that does the job better. For those that don’t, it’s your responsibility to abstract them away with code that does. Don’t sugar-coat a piece of technology just because it’s nice to play with, or because the community tells you so. Or in other words: don’t put all of your bets on one thing, but rather, build your product as a collection of many loosely-connected things. Let new libraries, tolling, and frameworks sprinkle out of your particular needs instead. This is how standards get born.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Running Achievements of 2018]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://strava.com">Strava</a> and use it not only to keep a record of my running activities, but also, to get a glimpse of what I have achieved at the end of each year.

This is one of the things that newbie programmers learn quickly after they realize that have committed sensitive information to a public GitHub repository. And it happens so easily. Often, you are in the spur of the moment, wanting to test something locally, when you figure out that you need some API key in order for your app to work. Adding the key to the code takes a second, and is just as easy to forget when committing. The <a href="https://12factor.net/">Twelve-Factor-App</a> methodology calls this a <em>violation</em>, and has whole <a href="https://12factor.net/config">section</a> on why should be externalized and read from the environment at runtime.</p><p>I used to avoid using environment variables, because they made it hard to set up a local environment for testing. I’d either pass all the assignments at the start, or use a cumbersome startup script to export them to the current shell.</p><p>Luckily, it is easy to improve the quality of your code, and ease testing in different environments at the same time. It has become somewhat of a standard practice to use <code>.env</code> (a.k.a dotenv) files for configuring sensitive data while testing across environments. A <em>dotenv</em> file contains nothing more than text, where  it has one environment variable assignment per line:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">ABC_KEY=1234xyz
DEF_KEY=2349875
DEBUG=True
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>Dotenv</em> files <strong>must be ignored</strong> from version control for exactly the same reason mentioned at the beginning of this post: exposing sensitive information as part of the project is bad. These files are only used to quickly set up or change an environment when needed.</p><h2 id="using-a-dotenv-file-in-our-app">Using a dotenv file in our app</h2><p>How do we get our Python app to read a <code>.env</code> file? <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/">python-dotenv</a> is a great Python package that does exactly that. It will search for a <code>.env</code> as part of the project, and if it finds one, will expose the variables in it to the app. All you need to do, is <code>pip install python-dotenv</code> and add the following couple of lines at the start of your project:</p><pre><code class="language-python">from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
</code></pre>
<p>The starting point may vary, depending on whether your project is a command line script, a Flask, or a Django project. For instance, in a Django project, the above two lines need to be added at the top of the <code>settings.py</code> file.</p><p>Having set <code>python-loadenv</code> up, the rest is easy. Create a <code>.env</code> file at the root of your app with all the environment variables needed to configure it, and make sure that you invoke them properly from your code (e.g. use something like <code>os.getenv('MY_API_KEY')</code>). Don’t forget to exclude the <code>.env</code> file from being checked into your source code repository!</p><h2 id="links">Links</h2><p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/">python-dotenv · PyPI</a><br><a href="http://12factor.net/">http://12factor.net/</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Year, a New Idea: The F-Word Detector]]></title><description><![CDATA[Remember Not Hotdog from HBOs Silicon Valley?

Yet, we also want to be better individuals, and avoid these becoming chronic, especially in common areas like the office.</p><p>This is how I came up with the idea ( <em>still, only an idea</em> ) of creating a detector application, which would <strong>monitor</strong> (more on this below) conversations around the office and count the usage of the F-word. When the count reaches a certain threshold, a certain thing would happen, like a funny meme GIF would be sent around on Slack, as a notice. Remember Not Hotdog from the <a href="http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley">HBO show <em>Silicon Valley</em></a>?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACmydtFDTGs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Silicon Valley: Season 4 Episode 4: Not Hotdog (HBO)</figcaption></figure><p>Ideally, a machine learning model should be able to distinguish between speech that contains the F-word, and speech that doesn’t. There are two big challenges though. One is purely the privacy aspect. I bet that no one would like it that a machine records their speech and even less so, sends it to servers overseas to get it analysed. The other aspect is the cost of having such a thing run all the time. Most cloud infrastructure providers have their own cloud-based speech-to-text APIs where they charge per number of requests. I can easily imagine how such a fun experiment can end up being money trap, costing thousands of dollars in usage fees.</p><p>So, our goal can be achieved only by manually training and using a machine learning model, to classify speech. Moreover, the app must only store recorded audio temporarily, as well as avoid using raw audio during either the training or testing periods. This, as well as open-sourcing the project are key ingredients in ensuring participants nothing of what they say will ever get stored, or potentially used against them (who said GDPR?).</p><p>On paper, achieving this is way not as difficult as it sounds. We need an app that does the following:</p><ol><li>Constantly listen to sounds coming from the device’s microphone</li><li>Turn the sounds between any two periods of silence into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a> images</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Spectrogram-19thC.png" class="kg-image" alt="A New Year, a New Idea: The F-Word Detector"><figcaption>Audio Spectrogram |&nbsp;Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><ol><li>During the training phase, half of the spectrums will be marked as ones containing the F-word, and the half, as one which do not contain it.</li><li>Having the the two distinct data sets, we can train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to try to distinguish between them</li><li>Having the trained model, the app will follow steps 1. and 2. and count a +1 , for every time when the ML model indicates an occurrence of the F-word beyond a certain threshold.</li></ol><p>As for turning audio in  a bitmap and using a CNN, which is especially effective for classifying bitmap data, is a tried and proven trick. There are quite a few experiments, which use CNNs in a combination with spectrogram images, to classify different genres of music. It is important to point out once again that our app will eventually distinguish between two classes only (F-word or not). In contrast, our model would be very unsuitable for something like speech-to-text recognition.</p><p>The next step in my journey is to try to implement a working version of the app, as well as find people willing enough to participate. I will try to document my progress on the blog.</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2><p><a href="https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3">How HBO’s Silicon Valley built “Not Hotdog” with mobile TensorFlow, Keras &amp; React Native</a><br><a href="https://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html">Recommending music on Spotify with deep learning – Sander Dieleman</a><br><a href="https://medium.com/@CVxTz/audio-classification-a-convolutional-neural-network-approach-b0a4fce8f6c">Audio Classification : A Convolutional Neural Network Approach</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dark Mode for the Web Using Dark Reader]]></title><description><![CDATA[Switch to using a dark UI everywhere, even when browsing your favorite Web pages.]]></description><link>https://preslav.me/2019/01/04/dark-mode-for-the-web-using-dark-reader/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c2ef215462c63186c157c1b</guid><category><![CDATA[Productivity]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ergonomics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Dev Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tips]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Preslav Rachev]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 05:47:48 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://preslav.me/content/images/2019/01/Image-2019-01-04-06-44-21-1.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2019/01/Image-2019-01-04-06-44-21-1.png" alt="Dark Mode for the Web Using Dark Reader"><p>Besides pineapple on the pizza and tabs vs spaces, the color theme of the working environment is a constant topic of discussions and arguing among developers. Truth is, you can hear as many opinions, as many people you ask, and all of them will be right for themselves.</p><p>There is something about dark UI that particularly pleases my eyesight. So much so, that I try to install a dark theme on every app I am using. I am glad that Apple thought the same way, and made it so that with Mojave, apps now can offer a dark UI out of the box.</p><p>But what about Web pages? Unfortunately, you can’t really switch the design the of every website, because each site’s CSS stylesheet is different and unique. It is up to website owners to <a href="https://paulmillr.com/posts/using-dark-mode-in-css/">detect the user’s UI settings</a>, and offer a corresponding theme. Or, so I thought.</p><p>Turns out that there is a solution for that, and one that works equally well for all browsers. It is called <a href="https://darkreader.org/">Dark Reader</a> and it is a simple browser extension, which you can turn on an off at will, or set up a whitelist, which will turn dark mode only for certain sites. The more advanced users can even mess with the default re-styling rules, creating new themes that suit their unique needs.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/849mznBKmIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Dark Reader for Google Chrome</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
